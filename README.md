#How to import?

If you want to use my library in Maven you have to copy those codes on your pom.xml.

First, you have to import the jitpack repository, because is where TimeOut libraries stored. You can do it adding the next code to your pom.xml:

	<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
  
  Next, you can import the dependency. You can do this adding the next code to your pom.xml:
  
  <dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.CGRU2001</groupId>
	    <artifactId>TimeOut</artifactId>
	    <version>Tag</version>
	</dependency>
  
  If you have more libraries in your project, place that code into the <dependencies> tags. However, if you haven't more repositories, just add the <dependencies> tags and place it inside
